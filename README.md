# Sentiment Predictor 🧠✨

A deep learning project to predict sentiment (positive/negative) on IMDb movie reviews.

## 📌 What I built
- Used Keras with TensorFlow backend
- Built a CNN-based text classifier
- Trained on 25,000 movie reviews, achieved ~85–87% accuracy

## 📊 Dataset
- IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset (from Keras)

## ⚙️ How to run
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run notebook:  
   ```
   jupyter notebook sentiment_predictor.ipynb
   ```
   or script:  
   ```
   python sentiment_predictor.py
   ```

## ✅ Results
- Test accuracy ~85–87%
- Example prediction on unseen review

## 🚀 Future work
- Test on custom text
- Add LSTM/GRU models for comparison
- Deploy as web app
